\textbf{Hint:} this document needs to be compiled with LuaLaTex, not pdfLaTeX.

If special characters can't be printed, it's usually because they are not
available in the font you are using. Fire Sans, for example, has most UTF-8
characters embedded. Examples: ʣ ʥ ñ

Some characters are only available in certain monospace
fonts like Fira Mono. Examples: \firamonooldstyle{┗ ┏}
